# ETCH-a-SKETCH

## The Purpose

I created this project as an excercise given by [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com)

Whenever you hover over an empty square it will fill in with the color black as if you were using the dials on an etch-a-sketch to draw your next masterpiece. If you click the reset button it will empty out the sketchpad and let you define how many empty squares you would like to have on each side of the sketchpad (up to a maximum of 100).
